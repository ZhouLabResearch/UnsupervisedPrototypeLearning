# UnsupervisedPrototypeLearning
Code for the paper "Unsupervised Blind SNR Region Estimation Using Prototype-Based Multi-Stage Deep Neural Network" located at: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10520631

Run using file 'unsup_main.m' and follow code sections that go through training a network to split a dataset with unsupervised methods. Additional sections involve using the network to split a dataset, training each dataset partition for modulation classification, and evaluating each network's performance.
